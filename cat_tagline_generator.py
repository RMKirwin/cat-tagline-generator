Cat Tagline Generator

This script demonstrates a complete AI pipeline that:
1. Fetches random cat images from the Cat As A Service API
2. Uses OpenAI's GPT-4 Vision to analyze and describe the images
3. Generates funny, meme-worthy taglines based on the descriptions

This is a great example of:
- API integration (REST API calls)
- AI/ML workflows (Vision AI + Text Generation)
- Error handling and user feedback
- Object-oriented programming in Python
